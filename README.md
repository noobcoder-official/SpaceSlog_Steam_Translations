# SpaceSlog Steam Translations

All the translations for Steam.


## How to translate:

- Create a new branch and rename it to whatever you like.
- Copy and rename Main to your desired language - ie 'Main-fr'.
- Replace the English text to your language.
- Create a pull request to merge.
- Please merge your work at the end of everyday day or asap to keep the main branch as upto date as possible. This makes it easier if others work on the same language.
- You may also need to 'pull' the main branch to your own branch to keep that upto date too.
